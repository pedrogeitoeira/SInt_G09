    "2. **Accuracy**: Given that the dataset is balanced, Accuracy is a useful metric as it gives a good overall sense of how well the model is performing across both classes (heart disease and no heart disease). A high Accuracy indicates that the model is making correct predictions most of the time.\n",
    "3. **Recall**: In a medical diagnosis context like heart disease, having high Recall ensures that fewer cases of actual heart disease go undiagnosed (minimizing false negatives), which is crucial for patient safety.\n",
    "4. **Precision**: If there are significant costs associated with false positives, such as unnecessary stress tests or invasive procedures, Precision should also be taken into account to ensure positive predictions are as accurate as possible.\n",
